# predictr - Easy and intuitive machine learning for the masses

This app provides a dashboard that can be used for predictive data science applications without in-depth knowledge of machine learning. It enables you to load in a dataset, choose what you'd like to predict, select the most appropriate model, make predictions and download results, without writing a single line of code.
